<!-- 
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
 It allows us to define different parts of a webpage, it also helps for accessibility. I see the section element as most useful because it allows us to neatly layout the structure of the page.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  It displays it in order from top to bottom.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  I learned how to create snippets in this challenge. I think I will create more snippets in the future.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  I'm still not so clear when to use the different semantic elements. I think by seeing more examples of these elements, I will be able to clearly understand when to apply them.
