# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the ability to keep track of changes made to a file and revert to older save points when necessary. It is useful for developers because they can keep track of changes made to code whether by an individual or team members, which allows them to clearly understand who is adding code, and the specific code that they are modifying at that point. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is essentially a 'department' of the main database in which developers can focus specifically on a certain part or feature of the project. I would use a branch in order to have a safe testing environment for my code before actually implementing it. This would allow me to fix any issues before an official release.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the creation of a save point of a file. A good commit message clearly describes the specific modifications made to the file since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when git reports an error while attempting to merge or integrate one branch into another. This can occur when the same file on two branches have conflicting modifications. For example, if both files have changes to the same line, this might cause a merge conflict and the user will resolve this conflict before completing a merge.
