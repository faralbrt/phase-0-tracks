# WEB SERVERS:
## Linux Design Philosophy:
Linux provides it's users with maximum control over the system.
It assumes that the user knows what he/she is doing.

## VPS
A virtual private server is a part of a computer's memory that is walled-off and acts like an independent server.
This is useful for testing and building small applications that do not need a dedicated server.
