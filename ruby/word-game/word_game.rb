# PLAN
# GOAL: reveal the letters of a word or the whole word by guessing
# create a WordGame class

# allow read access to the word_guessed
# allow access to read and change the secret_word
# initialize the secret_word = the word to be guessed
# initialize the secret_letters = array of letters in the word
# initialize the guess_count = 0
# initialize the guess_limit = length of word times 2
# initialize the win = false
# initialize the word_guessed = '-' multiplied by the length of the word

# create a method which determines if limit of guesses has been reached
  # if guess_count is greater than guess_limit
    # return true
  # Otherwise,
    # return false

# create a method that takes in a string as an argument
  # if the string matches the secret_word
    # set word_guessed equal to the secret_word
  # if the string matches one of the secret_letters
