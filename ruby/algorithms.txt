1. Algorithm for robot using elevator

(Assuming the robot is going up)

-set current_floor=1
-let desired_floor= value of the floor the robot wants to go to
-Align itself in a position equidistant to both sides of door frame
-Until it is at a point in the center of the elevator
	Until it senses the flash of a green upward arrow and elevator door slides open
		Walk in a straight path forward

-Determine a value for the variable desired_floor

-move finger to position at the most bottom left button on the "floor button Grid"
-let finger_position= current finger position on the "floor button grid"
-set finger_position= 1
	
-Until finger_position is equal to desired_floor
	-If a button is detected to the right of finger_position
		-Move finger_positon one button to the right
		-add 1 to the value of finger_position
	-Otherwise,
		-Until a button is detected to the right of finger_position
			-move one button up to the next row
			-move finger to the left-most position
			-add one to finger_position

-Until the button  with the value of finger_position has a flash of light around
	-Move finger straight into the button and pull finger back

"Determine when to exit the elevator"
-Let floor_display= Value of floor in the LED display in the elevator
-Until the current_floor is equal to desired_floor
	-Scan the floor_display in the elevator
		-If floor_display is not equal to current_floor
			-Set current_floor equal to floor_display

-Until the elevator doors are 5 feet behind
	-Walk in a straight path away from the back wall of the elevator

2. Eating cereal

- Wait until a bowl full of cereal and a spoon are in front of you
- Pick up the spoon
-Until bowl is empty
	-Until spoon is full of cereal
		-position spoon in a line perpendicular to the bowl
		-lower spoon into the bowl
		-lift spoon up and away from the bowl
	-Bring spoon close to mouth
	-Open mouth
	-put the spoon inside your mouth
	-Until the spoon is empty
		-tilt spoon up
	-pull spoon out of mouth
-you are done
-Place bowl and spoon in sink
